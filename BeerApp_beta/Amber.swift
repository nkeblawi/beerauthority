The malts may be sweet along with piney, caramel and nutty flavors. This style of beer, sometimes called \"Red Ales\" was created on the west coast of the United States and is now commonly found across the country. The alcohol content is usually between 4.5-6%. Nut Browns (or Brown Ales) offer very similar characteristics." + "\r\n"
