Slight grainy, corn-like sweetness from the use of maize with substantial offsetting hop bitterness. Rice-based versions are crisper, drier, and often lack corn-like flavors. Grassy, biscuit, and green apple flavor characteristics are common with pilsners. Alcohol content range between 4.5%-6%. The German and Bohemian-style pils are leaders in this style." + "\r\n"
