Moderate to fairly high fruitiness, often with a dried and dark fruit character. Hop bitterness may range from just enough for balance to a firm presence. Barleywines are often associated for special occasions and great aging candidates just like wine. Alcohol content tends to be 8% or higher." + "\r\n"
