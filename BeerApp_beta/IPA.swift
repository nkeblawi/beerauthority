Color is from golden amber to light copper, usually with an orange tint. Flavor characters are typically floral, piney or resinous, fruity and citrus-like. Malts are used to balance the hop bitterness. Alcohol content ranges from 5-7.6%. Imperial India Pale Ales (Double IPAs) are much higher in alcohol content and hop." + "\r\n"
