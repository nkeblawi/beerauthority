The flavor has a moderate roasted malt taste that usually includes milk chocolate, oatmeal, coffee or licorice flavors. Hop flavor is usually non-existent although some bittering is used for balance. Porters are similar to brown ales, but are thicker and have more of a roasted flavor. The alcohol content is usually in the 4-7% range. A popular style for this beer are Baltic Porters (originates from countries in the Baltic Sea area) which are higher in alcohol content and richer in mouthfeel." + "\r\n"
