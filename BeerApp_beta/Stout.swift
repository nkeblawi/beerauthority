They are bold, dry roasted, coffee and chocolate-forward ales that sometimes integrate interesting flavors such as marshmallows. Stouts have a thick body and high head retention. Alcohol content is usually between 4.5-7.5%. Russian Imperial Stouts (these beers were brewed by England for export to Russia as they were popular with the imperial court there) are much higher in alcohol content and hop bitterness. Barrel-aged stouts also have become a phenomenon over the years." + "\r\n"
